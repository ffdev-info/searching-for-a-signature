## Teaching us how to do it

Now you've tried one, can you teach one?

:::: callout

If you are working on this outside of a workshop don't worry if you haven't
a group to share with. It is still work working through these steps to improve
your understanding. Well done on getting this far!

See below for some ideas on what you might do at this point.

::::

## Teach the workshop

Following your efforts in the previous exercise can you describe to the
group what you did and what you learned?

1. where did you begin your research?
1. what considerations did you have when writing a signature?
1. are there any alternatives you might consider?

Evaluating your efforts:

1. what worked well?
1. what didn't work?
1. what questions you still have?
1. is there anything else you'd like to share with the group?

## Teach locally

Teaching outside of a workshop environment is no small feat! If you're
happy where you are, then you are welcome to wrap up this tutorial with
the final two episodes.

If you are keen, however, some ideas for you to share your efforts from
this tutorial might be:

1. Write a blog for the [Open Preservation Foundation][opf-1] or your own
organization sharing your thoughts, e.g
like [Andrea's here](akb-1).
1. Visit the show-and-tell section of the workshop's repisotory and share
your thoughts!
1. Organize a show-and-tell in your organization and share your
experience with your colleagues, maybe even as a teaser for running
this material as a workshop for yourself!

<!-- NB. Keypoints should appear at the end of the markdown file. Aesthetically
     it looks like it's better with an additional newline so adding that
     here and using this comment as a separator to make it easy to read
     content.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Seeing one, doing one, teaching one allows you to reinforce what you've
learned.
- Teaching one helps you to exernalise and formalize your language around this
work making it easier to articulate in future in other forums.
