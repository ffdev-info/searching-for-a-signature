:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- Do my samples have the same “magic” numbers?
- What version do these files represent?
- Do I need more samples to draw conclusions?
- Do I have access to a format specification?


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Recognize patterns in sample files.
- Have more confidence in deciding which values to use in a signature.
- Read a format specification and draw conclusions.

<!-- NB. Keypoints should appear at the end of the markdown file. Aesthetically
     it looks like it's better with an additional newline so adding that
     here and using this comment as a separator to make it easy to read
     content.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The more samples from different versions of the format can ensure better identification.
- Not all formats have available specifications
- The more variations in samples, patterns emerge.
