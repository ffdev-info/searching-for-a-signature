Kia ora, and welcome to Searching for a Signature: A File Format
Identification Workshop. This workshop loosely follows the concept
of **See one**, **Do one**, **Teach one**. Depending on how much time
you have for your workshop the balance between teaching and student
engagement may vary. We recommend around 1.5 hours for teaching
(including some engagement and interaction) and an additional 45 minutes for
more interactive workshop activities and sharing.
