Kia ora, and welcome to Searching for a Signature: A file format identification
workshop. This workshop follows the idea of **See one**, **do one**,
**teach one**. While this has been designed as a workshop we hope that folks
will use this resource as a module that can be self-taught, as well as
a module they may choose to teach others.
