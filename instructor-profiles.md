### Jesse

Jesse works in an institutional repository and has taken sole responsibility
for signature development up until now. Their current colleagues are
interested in learning more, and new colleagues are being onboarded. They
want to be able to teach signature development in a handful of small
workshops within their organization; they also want to be able to share
these resources with their colleagues so that they can reference them in
the future.

### Isla

Isla is a file format identification expert and regularly contributes to
resources in the community. They are excited to share their workflows and
knowledge and have an opportunity to present a workshop at an upcoming
conference. Ideally, they will add their knowledge to an existing resource
to help organize the workshop, and they will take it from there!
