| Binary Signature              | The definition of an identification pattern used by file format identification tools. A Binary Signature can have 1 or more Binary Signature Patterns, and all patterns for a given signature must match to return a hit and receive positive identification. A PRONOM file format entry can have 0 or more Binary Signatures, and if any of these signiatures match they will return a hit and receive positive identification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                           |                                |

| Byte-order                    | Byte order, or endianness, is a computer system's convention for how multi-byte data like integers are stored in computer memory or transmitted over a network. The two main types are big-endian, which places the most significant byte first, and little-endian, which places the least significant byte first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                           |                                |
| Character Sets                | A defined collection of characters, i.e. letters, numbers, symbols and control codes, that a computer can store, display, and manipulate.

| Container Signature           | An alternative definition of an identification pattern used by file format identification tools, used when files are themselves Containers, based on ZIP or OLE, that under-the-hood contain multiple files that could be individually interrogated and processed.<br><br>A Container Signature can have 1 or more Container Signature Patterns, and all patterns for a given signature must match to return a hit and receive positive identification. A PRONOM file format entry can have 0 or more Container Signatures, and if any of these signiatures match they will return a hit and receive positive identification.<br><br>Usually a PRONOM format entry will only be associated with Binary Signatures, OR Container Signatures (i.e. not both), however some older PRONOM format entries are still associated with both.<br><br>A Container Signature has two additional elements beyond a Binary Signature: 1) A Container Type (currently either ZIP or OLE) that means that if a file format identification tool encounters a matching Binary Signature pattern for the Container Type then the Container Signature File will be assessed for matches. 2) A Path, which is a filepath internal to the container that must be present for a hit to occur. A Path may also be associated with additional Signature Patterns associated with the BOF, EOF, or Variably within the subfile referenced by the Path, that must all match for a hit to occur. In the absence of any Signature Patterns being defined for a given Path, the existence of the Path is enough to return a hit. |                                           |                                |
| Container Signature File      | A file used by the file format identification tool, that stores all of its Container Signature definitions and their associations with PRONOM file format entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                           |                                |

| Footer                        | A defined section within a file format that typically includes data that will give information to a processing software application. This is not as common as a Header. In some cases, certain software vendors have unofficially extended formal file format definitions, by adding their own data to the end of a given file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                           |                                |
