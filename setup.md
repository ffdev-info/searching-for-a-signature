## Room setup

Before we get started, organize yourself in the room so that you are able
to split into groups of three or more. This will make the final part of
the workshop easier.

## Workshop files

<!-- NB: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then
     use a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide
     a link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->

Suggest we have some workshop files in the `data/` folder TBD...
