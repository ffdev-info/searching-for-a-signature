## Teach one

Now you've tried one, can you teach one?

1. Split into groups of three
1. Pick one of the samples in the samples folder…
1. Work together to create a signature…
1. Plug it into DROID/Siegfried
1. Two groups to share their results at the end of the session…
Questions…

:::: callout

If you are working on this outside of a workshop don't worry if you haven't
a group to share with. It is still work working through these steps to improve
your understanding. Well done on getting this far!

<!-- NB. Keypoints should appear at the end of the markdown file. Aesthetically
     it looks like it's better with an additional newline so adding that
     here and using this comment as a separator to make it easy to read
     content.
